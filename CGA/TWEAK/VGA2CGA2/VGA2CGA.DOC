    WHAT IS VGA2CGA ?

    VGA2CGA is a utility that converts/views colored GIF pictures (256 colors 
    and less) and any of the following listed below to [1] error-distributed, 
    4-color dithered CGA or 16-Color CGA pictures, with a special unsupported 
    mode; CGA users can convert/view up to 405 colors (from 16 color dither 
    patterns).  VGA2CGA saves to GIF or .CGX (for the unsupported mode); you 
    can use VGA2CGA as a CGA viewer for use in batch (.BAT) files.

    1)   ANY colored GIF picture (32 colors and up recommended), with any 
         size (up to 2048 x 2048 x 256).

    2)   ANY VIEWABLE VGA/MCGA 320x200x256 picture captured with VGACAP;

    3)   VGACAD pictures;

    4)   16-color pictures converted to 320x200x256 with EGA2VGA.













    VGA2CGA uses a unique error-distribution algorithm; it uses a Floyd- 
    Steinberg matrix with Stucki filter values (8,4,2,2).  Users can 
    individually adjust the color and contrast levels and dither density.

    CGA2VGA supports a "quarter-resolution" mode by direct manipulation of 
    CGA registers.  16 colors can be displayed at any time.  The effective 
    pixel resolution is 640x200x16 with 405 color dither combinations.

    WHAT IS VGACAP ?

    VGACAP is a terminate-stay-resident (TSR) utility that captures 256 color 
    palettes and screens in VGA/MCGA 320x200x256 color mode.  VGACAP will 
    capture and "Bsave" the pictures of commercial and other Shareware 
    viewing/painting/graphics/CAD programs.


    REQUIREMENTS

    VGA2CGA requires, at the minimum, a 100% IBM Hardware Compatible CGA 
    card.  Hercules users with HGCIBM may find that the program works on 
    their system, BUT ONLY WITH OPTION (1) AT THE MAIN MENU.

    SVGA and EEGA card users must set CGA hardware emulation to see the 
    unsupported 160x100x16 or 80x100x"405" mode  (e.g, "SETMODE IBMCGA" on 
    STB VGA cards).

    About 512KB of memory is required, although it uses about 2/3 of that.

    You MUST have a VGA or MCGA adaptor (at least BIOS compatible) present 
    and an analog monitor to use VGACAP.  VGACAP uses less than 2K of RAM.


    HOW TO USE VGACAP

    Run VGACAP before entering your painting/CAD or digitized picture 
    viewer.   Press <ALT-F10>, while viewing your picture in any paint/CAD 
    program and your current screen and palette will be saved in your default 
    drive and directory in the standard Bsave format for all BASIC programs.

    The first time you run the program it will save your screen and palette 
    to SCREEN00.BLD and SCREEN00.PLT respectively.  If there is an existing 
    SCREENxx.BLD or SCREENxx.PLT file, then it will increment to the next 
    higher number.  You can use your favorite memory managers to remove this 
    TSR or reboot to release it from memory.

         Note:  When in DOS or using a picture viewer (e.g., PICEM, VPIC, 
         VGAGIF) or application which requires a keypress to continue, it is 
         necessary to hit another key after hitting the 'HOTKEY'.















    LOADING PICTURES INTO VGA2CGA

    Two formats are accepted by VGA2CGA: GIF and BLD/PLT files;  At the start 
    of the program, you will be prompted to select [G]IF or [B]LD files to to 
    selected or [Q]uit to exit.

    All pictures are interpolated to a 320x200 size.  As such, SuperVGA GIF 
    files (e.g., 640x480x256, 800x600x256 and 1024x768x256) are interpolated 
    to 320x200x256;  SQZGIF is recommended for LARGE GIF pictures to retain 
    more color information and better color rendition.

    16-color EGA/EEGA/VGA pictures will also be interpolated; use EGA2VGA to 
    process such pictures before loading into VGA2CGA.

    You can select any filename by moving a highlighted bar (with the arrow 
    keys) and pressing the <return> key.  Pressing <Spc> allows you to select 
    a different PATH, while <Esc> exits.  When selecting a *.BLD file, be 
    sure it has a corresponding  *.PLT file or a error message will result.

    PATHs MUST end with a backslash character "\" or your specified PATH will 
    be rejected (an error beep will result).  The following are legal PATH 
    examples:

              "A:\"
              "B:\"
              "C:\GIF\"
              "D:\GIF\VGA\LARGE\"

    Every captured picture, VGACAD picture, converted EGA2VGA or SQZGIF or 
    MAC2GIF picture will have two files:screen and palette.  The extension 
    .BLD stands for BLoaD and .PLT for PaLetTe.


    THE MAIN MENU


    After successful loading of your picture you will see these options:

    (1)  Red-Grn-Yel Plane Dithering 320 x 200 x 4   (IBM-STD w/ GIF save)

    (2)  EGA Low Contrast Emulation  160 x 100 x 16  (NON-STD w/ CGX save)
    (3)  EGA Med Contrast Emulation  160 x 100 x 16  (NON-STD w/ CGX save)
    (4)  EGA Hi  Contrast Emulation  160 x 100 x 16  (NON-STD w/ CGX save)
    (5)  EGA Monochrome   Emulation  160 x 100 x 16  (NON-STD w/ CGX save)

    (6)  HI Color Averaged Dithering  80 x 100 x 405 (NON-STD w/ CGX save)
    (7)  LO Color Averaged Dithering  80 x 100 x 405 (NON-STD w/ CGX save)
    (8)  Grey     Averaged Dithering  80 x 100 x 13  (NON-STD w/ CGX save)

    Select the letter or the number to initiate that function or option.












    VIEWING & SAVING

    Whenever you select a viewing mode you will have the option change the 
    path and file names for saving.

              Pathname               : C:\GIF\
              Filename               : NONAME.GIF

    While viewing the picture in CGA 320x200x4 mode you can change the 
    palette to alter the tone of the picture by pressing numbers 0-9.

    With unsupproted modes 2 to 8, only saves to a CGX file are allowed since 
    it is a weird text screen format; the .CGX extension is provided to avoid 
    confusion with your other .BIN files.   To use VGA2CGA as a viewer type 
    "VGA2CGA [picname]" without the extension.

    Pressing <return> while viweing saves your converted picture; pressing 
    <Esc> aborts processing and saving.


    FINE TUNING

    To get the BEST color dithering or color matching, interactively adjust 
    the color levels, contrast levels and dither density levels.

    When you select (F)ine Tuning, you can adjust the global amounts of Red, 
    Green and Blue in you picture.  At default it is 100%; this can be 
    increased up to 200%  The CGA 320x200x4 color mode uses only red and 
    Green; Blue is disregarded.

    While "fine tuning", you can adjust the contrast levels for each of the 
    RGB planes; this has no effect on color-averaging and is limited to the 
    red-green-yellow dithering 320x200x4 mode.  Increasing the contrast will 
    increase the amount of "black" in the picture by making a sharp cutoff 
    (i.e., no color will be plotted).

    Dither Density is how closely packed neighboring pixel will be; at 
    default this is set to 1 - the highest density possible.  If you want to 
    "spread the dots" you can increase this level up to 200.


    REGISTRATION


    BONUS: Registered users of VGACAD v1.4-1.5, VGA2EGA v1-2, SQZGIF 
           v1.0-v1.3, GIFDOT v1.0-1.3, MAC2GIF v1-2 and/or EGA2VGA v1-3 
           and/or GIFPUB v1.0-v1.4 are registered.  Copy your REGISTER.OVL 
           file into the directory of VGA2CGA and it will operate as a 
           registered version.  IF YOU HAVE NOT REGISTERED ANY OF THESE 
           PROGRAMS, DO SO NOW; when VGACAD v1.60 is released, all new 
           releases will require REGISTER.V16 to operate as a non-shareware 
           version.














    For 19.95 (outside of U.S.A. add USD $15.00) you will be entitled to the 
    latest update of VGA2CGA and REGISTER.V16 file (when released).  The 
    following programs listed below are provided (latest copy or update) to 
    registered users.  As much as possible, we are changing all utilities to 
    work with ANY video card; programs that, at present, work with ANY video 
    card are: GIFPUB, GIFDOT, EGA2VGA, MAC2GIF and SQZGIF.  We intend to 
    release as many utilities to with device-independent capabilities. If you 
    upgrade to EGA or VGA, please inform us as soon as possible so that we 
    may send you EGA-dependent and VGA-dependent releases too.


    * Device-independent utilities

    GIFPUB - converts 256 color GIFs to B&W images of varying sizes for 
    desktop publishing/printing as .PCX (ZSoft format for Ventura Desk Top 
    Publisher, First Publisher, Publisher's Paintbrush, PC  Paintbrush+) or 
    rename files to .PCC for importing in Aldus Pagemaker.

    SQZGIF - converts LARGE GIF pictures (up to 2048x2048x256) to 320x200x256 
    using interpolation and "color averaging" techniques to blend/smooth 
    "jaggies" inherent in reducing LARGE GIFS while retaining a maximum of 
    color information.

    MAC2GIF - converts .MAC ("readmac") pictures to 5-16 grey shades or color 
    and saves results as .GIF or BLD/PLT file, and other formats; graphics 
    are viewable in VGA, MCGA or EGA - no video card is required for direct 
    Black & White conversion to GIF.

    EGA2VGA (v3.0) - converts GIFs (16 colors and below) or ANY VIEWABLE 2-16 
    color EGA/EEGA picture to 320x200x256; creates 256 new colors; outputs 
    directly to GIFPUB, GIFDOT, VGACAD, VGA2CGA or VGA2EGA.


    * Device-dependent utilities/applications

    high frequency-boosting, ... more), Bezier/spline curves, multi-featured 
    Cut&Paste, variable sizing, multi-directiona 256-color gradient fills, 
    256 color 16x16 pattern fills, and a LOT of other 256-color capabilities.














    Whats next ?

    SYNPCX is utility to convert dithered, monochrome .PCX (Zsoft) files to 
    smooth grey shades.  This utility is primarily designed to convert 
    scanned (e.g., Logitech & DFI hand scanners) Black & White images, saved 
    to a .PCX file, for use and image processing with VGACAD, redithering 
    with GIFPUB, printing with GIFDOT, or EGA conversion with VGA2EGA.  
    SYNPCX will be graphics device independent (No Video Required).

     We are also, developing VGASHW (a 256-color presentation system), VGACBT 
    (the PROGRAMMABLE Computer-Based Training counterpart of VGASHW) AND 
    MANNEQUIN (what "Weird Science" tried to do in the movie it will do on 
    the computer screen with potential applications for Advertising and 
    Fashion Design, aside from creating your own artistic nudes).

    If you support maverick authors like us, we will continue to develop 
    innovative products like nothing seen commercially - otherwise they will, 
    as many (sigh!) good Shareware programs, simply "DIE" from lack of 
    support !  Compare the cost/benefit ratio of any of our products with 
    commercial products; we want to continue supporting and developing these 
    products.  Please support the User-Supported  (Shareware) concept; you, 
    and you alone, determine whether it will be worthwhile to continue 
    developing.
