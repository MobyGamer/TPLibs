These files are direct exports of the master files used for typesetting
the printed manuals. Please note that, for obvious reasons, the files do
not include any of the diagrams and screen shots which form part of the
final manual, nor any of the typestyle changes used to emphasize headings
and subheadings.

Also, note that the bound manuals are printed on 7" by 9" paper in a 
9 point proportional typeface. This means that it is unlikely that the
embedded page references will correspond to the page as printed
on a 8.5" by 11" 12 point monospaced page! The index and detailed table
of contents are not included because of the page reference problem.
