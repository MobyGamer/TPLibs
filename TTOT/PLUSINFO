                            1    INSTALLATION
                            2    COMPILING DEMOS
                            3    OVERLAYING UNITS

1 Installation
--------------
The Install program can install the Object Toolkit for Turbo Pascal and 
Pascal+. If you select the Pascal+ installation, in addition to copying 
the source, demonstration, and documentation files, the Install program 
can automatically create an Object Library Module TOT.LIB and TOT.SBL. 
Once created, these files significantly speed up the compile and link 
process.

If you have already installed the Object Toolkit but did not create the
LIB module, you should do so before proceeding. A log file has been
installed in the directory \TJOCK\TOT. This logfile can be used to
automatically generate a LIB file. (For more information on log files, 
refer to page 40 of the Pascal+ Utilities Reference).

To run the log file change directories to \TJOCK\TOT and execute the
SBE.EXE file, passing two parameters "TOT TOT", e.g.
                \path\SBE TOT TOT
The SBE will be invoked, and the LIB files will be automatically created.
Be  patient, and do not interrupt the process. The whole process may take
between 10 and 20 minutes. Once completed, the \TJOCK\TOT will contain the
files TOT.SBL and TOT.LIB.


2 Compiling Demo Programs
-------------------------

This text is no substitute for reading the manual, however, if you
want to get a quick feel for the Object Toolkit's (and Pascal+'s!)
capabilities, try the following steps.

STEP 1 - Change directories to the Toolkit demo, e.g. CD\TJOCK\TOTDEMO

STEP 2 - Load SBE creating a TOTDEMO SBL, e.g. \SBPASCAL\SBE TOTDEMO

STEP 3 - Enter Y at the prompt.

STEP 4 - Select Options Environment from the menu, and change the compiler
         to "Protected Mode Yes".

STEP 5 - Select Options Directories and change the include file path to
         "SOURCE;\TJOCK\TOT\SOURCE"

STEP 6 - Select New Library and enter "\TJOCK\TOT\TOT"

STEP 7 - Select New Program and enter "TOTDEMO"

STEP 8 - Select the Run menu option (by pressing Alt-R).

The TOTDEMO.EXE file will then be compiled and linked. If you have sufficient
memory, the program will then be executed, otherwise, exit SBE and execute
TOTDEMO from DOS.

You are up and running with Pascal+ and the Object Toolkit!


3  Overlaying Units
-------------------

Pascal+ handles overlays differently to Turbo Pascal. Briefly, to create a 
program with overlays, the units to be overlayed must be compiled in the 
{$O+} state (no differences so far!). In the main program, however, you
do not use an OVERLAY unit, and the units to be overlayed should *not*
be specified with the {$0 unitname} directive. Pascal+ requires an EDF file
to identify which units are to be overlayed.

The demonstration files DEMOV1.PAS and DEMOV1.EDF files illustrate how to
overlay with Pascal+.
