			    LICENSE AGREEMENT

This is an agreement between _______________________________________,
hereafter Licensee, and Ralf Brown, hereafter Author, regarding a
nonexclusive license to use the source code to the product known as
SPAWNO.  Unless otherwise noted, the term "Source Code" shall refer to
those portions of the complete source code which are not included in
the public distribution of SPAWNO; all files which fall into this
category are marked with the Licensee's name and a unique serial number.

The Licensee agrees to abide by the following terms and conditions
upon the use of the Source Code:

 1. The Source Code is licensed to the Licensee and neither the Source
    Code nor any derivatives may be redistributed or transferred without
    prior written permission.  The sole exception shall be distribution
    to multiple programmers actively working on the development of a
    single product.

 2. Object code created from the Source Code or derivatives of the
    Source Code may be incorporated into the Licensee's own works and
    distributed provided that
       a) the embedded copyright notice is not altered or removed; the
	  addition of the Licensee's own copyright notice is permitted.
       b) such inclusion is acknowledged in the documentation; a
	  statement similar to the following is sufficient:
	     "This program uses a customized version of Ralf Brown's
	      SPAWNO routines to minimize memory use while running
	      other programs or shelling to DOS."

 3. Object code created from the Source Code, or any derivatives
    thereof, which is not incorporated into the Licensee's own works
    may be distributed provided that
       a) the embedded copyright notice is not altered or removed; the
	  addition of the Licensee's own copyright notice is permitted.
       b) the complete original publicly-available version of
	  SPAWNO is included in said distribution.

 4. The Licensee agrees to abide by the distribution restrictions on any
    pre-release ("beta") software which may accompany the Source Code.

 5. The Licensee acknowledges that the Source Code (both public and
    licensed portions) and any pre-release software are provided AS IS
    with no warrantees, express or implied, including (but not limited
    to) correctness, merchantability, or fitness for use.  The Author
    disclaims all liability for damages, both consequential and
    incidental, resulting from the use or misuse of the SPAWNO package
    or pre-release software. Sole responsibility for determining the
    fitness of SPAWNO for a particular use rests with the Licensee.

I have read and agree to the above conditions on the use of SPAWNO
source code.

[In plain English: You can distribute the licensed source code to the
members of your programming team, but no further; you can use SPAWNO in
your product as long as you give me credit; you can distribute modified
versions of the libraries as long as you include the originals; keep betas
confidential; and don't blame me for any problems you may encounter.]
